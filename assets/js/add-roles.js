/*
First, we are going to need to bring in inquirer and my sql
    I am also going to need to bring in the mysql connection

The employee roles function will go as follows
    --They will need to enter the title for the role (manager, server, bartender, etc)
        --that role will get assigned an id that will be pushed to the database 
    --they will need to enter a salary for that role
        --the salary will get aved to that role
    --they will need to select a department from the departments they have made
        --once they pick a department for that role, the department_id will be assigned to that role
    --they will then be asked if they would like to add another role -
        --if they choose yes, it will rerun the create a role funciotn
        --if they choose no, it will ask them if they would like to add an employee for that role
        if they choose no, it will console log(you have no employees if none exist)
            --then it will take them back to the main menue
